# Quantum Variational Algorithms - Eigensolvers

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks implementing and exploring several important variational algorithms in quantum computing, used for quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning:

- **VQE.ipynb**  
  Demonstrates the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for estimating the ground state energy of a Hamiltonian.

- **VQD.ipynb**  
  Explores the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm, which extends VQE to find excited states of a Hamiltonian, enabling a more complete spectral analysis.

- **SSVQE.ipynb**  
  Implements the Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE), another approach to obtain multiple eigenstates of a Hamiltonian within a single variational framework.

- **QSR.ipynb**  
  Presents the Quantum Sampling Regression (QSR) algorithm, which find the ground state of a Hamiltonian in a single quantum computation.

These notebooks provide a hands-on introduction to variational quantum algorithms and their applications in both quantum simulation and quantum-enhanced learning.
