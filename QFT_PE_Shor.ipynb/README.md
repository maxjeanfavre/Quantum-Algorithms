# Quantum Fourier Transform, Phase Estimation & Shor's Algorithm

This folder explores the deep connections between the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), phase estimation, and quantum algorithms for factoring:

- **QFT.ipynb**  
  Introduces and demonstrates the Quantum Fourier Transform, a key primitive in many quantum algorithms.

- **phase_estimation.ipynb**  
  Presents the quantum phase estimation algorithm, which uses the QFT to estimate the eigenvalues (phases) of unitary operators.  

- **Shor_IBM_tutorial.ipynb**  
  Implements Shorâ€™s algorithm for integer factorization, one of the most famous quantum algorithms, which is powered by phase estimation and the QFT.  
  Based on the official IBM/Qiskit tutorial.

These notebooks show how fundamental concepts like the QFT and phase estimation come together to enable groundbreaking quantum algorithms.
