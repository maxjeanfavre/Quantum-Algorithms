# Quantum Key Distribution: BB84 and E91 Protocols

This folder presents two fundamental protocols for quantum key distribution (QKD):

- **BB84.ipynb**  
  Demonstrates the BB84 protocol, the first and most widely known QKD protocol. BB84 uses quantum states and the no-cloning theorem to securely distribute a cryptographic key between two parties.

- **E91.ipynb**  
  Implements the E91 protocol, which leverages entanglement and Bellâ€™s inequalities to achieve secure key distribution. E91 showcases the role of quantum nonlocality and is more resilient to certain types of eavesdropping.

Together, these notebooks illustrate how quantum mechanics can enable secure communication channels, laying the foundation for quantum cryptography.
